# Opruaas - Optimism Rollup as a service

Optimism Rollup As A Service. Easily deploy and manage rollups with the Optimism stack.

## Opruaas cli

Install with `npm i -g @wakeuplabs/opruaas`

### System Requirements

Ensure you have the following tools installed and properly configured:

- **Docker**: `>= 24.0.0`
- **kubectl**: `>= 1.28.0`
- **Helm**: `>= 3.0.0`
- **Terraform**: `>= 1.9.8` (with AWS authentication configured)
- **Git**: `>= 2.0.0`

To run it all smoothly we recommend:

- 16 GB Ram specially if building contracts image, otherwise 8 GB should get things moving as well.
- 25+ GB free on top of installed programs (This should account for images and volume claims (customizable from values.yaml))

### Commands

Usage: `opruaas [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>`

#### Available Commands:

- `new` Create a new project, template config file, and folders
- `init` Initialize a new project
- `build` Compile sources and create Docker images
- `release` Tag and push the already built Docker images to the registry for deployment
- `dev` Spin up a local development environment
- `deploy` Deploy your blockchain. Target must be one of: `contracts`, `infra`, `all`
- `inspect` Get details about the current deployment. Target must be one of: `contracts`, `infra`
- `help` Print this message or the help for the given subcommand(s)

#### Options:

- `-q`, `--quiet` Suppress logging output
- `-h`, `--help` Print help
- `-V`, `--version` Print version

### Create a New Project and Build Releases from Source

Follow these steps to create a new project and build releases:

```bash
# 1. Create your project
npx opruaas new my-chain && cd my-chain

# 2. Fill out the config.toml and .env files

# 3. Pull sources with init (target can be one of: all | batcher | node | geth | contracts)
npx opruaas init contracts

# 4. Build the images
npx opruaas build contracts

# 5. Release the build
# Ensure Docker is properly configured with permissions to push to your target repository
npx opruaas release contracts
```

### Test releases with dev

The dev command simplifies the setup for local testing. It performs the following actions:

1. Starts an L1 Node: Launches a Geth-based Layer 1 node.
2. Deploys Deterministic Contracts: Sets up the deterministic contract deployer on the node.
3. Deploys Your Chain Contracts: Automatically deploys your chain-specific contracts.
4. Installs Helm Chart: Configures the corresponding Helm chart on your local machine for testing.

**Prerequisites**

- You need to provide the `container registry` and the release `name` for your deployment.
- For reference, you can use the example configuration at `wakeuplabs` with the release name `v0.0.4`.

**Usage**
Run the following command to execute the setup:

```bash
# Use -v for verbose output; recommended as the process may take some time
npx opruaas -v dev
```

Once all deployments are up and running, it may take some time for the system to become fully responsive. This includes:

- RPC responsiveness: The RPC endpoint may initially take a few moments to respond to queries.
- Explorer indexing: The block explorer will need time to finish indexing before it can display your transactions.

**Testing Your Setup**

If you have cast installed, the following commands can help you test the deployment and interact with the setup:

```bash
cast chain-id --rpc-url http://localhost:80/rpc

cast balance 0x3fAB184622Dc19b6109349B94811493BF2a45362 --rpc-url http://localhost:80/rpc

cast send \
  --from 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266 \
  --private-key ac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 \
  --rpc-url http://localhost:80/rpc \
  --value 1ether \
  0x3fAB184622Dc19b6109349B94811493BF2a45362
```

In dev mode, all wallets on both L1 and L2 will be funded by default. This is achieved by automatically setting `fund_dev_accounts` to `true`.

Once the setup is complete, you can access the following services:

- L1 RPC: http://localhost:8545
- L2 RPC: http://localhost:80/rpc
- Off-chain Monitoring: http://localhost:80/monitoring
- Explorer: http://localhost:80

### Deploy contracts/infra/all

Ensure that your `config.toml` configuration file is properly set up before proceeding.

```bash
# Use -v for verbose output; recommended for detailed progress logs.
npx opruaas -v deploy all --name my-prod-deployment
```

- Optional Flag:
  Add `--deploy-deployer` if the L1 chain does not already have a deployer. For most popular L1 chains, this step is unnecessary.

The deployment process will create a deployments/my-prod-deployment directory containing the generated artifacts.

- Artifacts:
  These files are crucial for running your chain. Ensure you keep them safe and do not lose them.
- Inspecting Artifacts:
  You can manually review the artifacts or use the inspect command for easier analysis.
